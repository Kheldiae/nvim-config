# My personal Neovim config

## Try it out!

That's right! You can take my Neovim configuration for a spin _right now_, without clobbering your existing configuration!

Just clone this repository and run the `nvim` script at its root!

## Install it

This repository follows the format for Neovim's runtime directory, meaning you can clone it directly into `~/.config/nvim` on your system.

This configuration works best with Nix, but it isn't a hard requirement. You can also import the `neovim` package in this Nix flake into your NixOS configuration.

## Useful keybindings

This configuration specifies a few keybindings, most of which were created with the French AZERTY layout in mind. All keybinds are defined in `init.vim.d/50-keybinds.vim` and are shared between Vim and Goyo mode where applicable.

Here's a list of all non-default keybindings in this Neovim config:

Keys  | Action                          | Vim command
------|---------------------------------|------------
`jk`  | Escape (in insert and term mode)|
      |                                 |
`b…`  | _**Buffer commands**_           |

This configuration also includes [Visual-Multi] and its keybindings.

## Goyo

This configuration also includes a [Goyo] setup, to have a distraction-free editor built into Neovim. To use it, just run the `goyo` script at the config's root or launch this command :

```shell
nvim --cmd "let g:startGoyo = 1"
```

However, if you use the version in my `zsh` config and kitty, you may experience some... Weird things if you put the goyo editor in the background of your terminal.
